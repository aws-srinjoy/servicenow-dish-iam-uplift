  "Rationale": "Users with the PutKeyPolicy permission for a CMK can completely replace the key policy for a CMK with a different key policy of their choice.",

Ensure any attached policies are for authorized use cases only and have sufficient preventive controls and monitoring alerts. Enforce with preventive controls (e.g., service control policies). Detect on any AWS API calls to put key policy.",
