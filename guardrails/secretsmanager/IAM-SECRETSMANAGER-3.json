  "Guardrail": "Check for separation of duties between managing a secret and reading or writing to a secret.",
  "Rationale": "An administrator is required to manage creating secret via CreateSecret. Though populating the secret value including both reading GetSecretValue and writing the secret PutSecretValue should be performed by a separate principal, ideally only automation should be generating a (random) secret value and rotating the secret. Separating out the management from actually viewing the secret data reduces the risk of unauthorized access.",
  "Remediation": "Check that the administration CreateSecret principal is separate from the secret value principal GetSecretValue and PutSecretValue.",
