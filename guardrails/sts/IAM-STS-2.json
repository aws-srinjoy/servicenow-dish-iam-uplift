  "Identifier": "IAM-STS-2",
  "Guardrail": "Check that usage of Principal \"*\" is not allowed without the usage of proper condition keys",
  "Rationale": "A principal setting of \"*\" allows any authenticated AWS Identity to assume that role, provided they know the ARN. Broadly assumable roles should be considered an anti-pattern in most cases. If a use case arises that it is unavoidable (when you need to provide external access to multiple identities to resources that donâ€™t support resource policies), the Assume Role Policy should be properly scoped with conditions to limit access",
  "Remediation": "Add the condition aws:PrincipalOrgId, or aws:PrincipalArn with an account number, or aws:SourceAccount",
  "References": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html",
