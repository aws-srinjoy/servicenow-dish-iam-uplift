  "Identifier": "IAM-SQS-2",
  "Guardrail": "Check that only authorized principals are able to invoke SendMessage or SendMessageBatch.",
  "Rationale": "Unauthorized principals can flood the SQS queues, potentially resulting in large costs or a denial of service against the SQS queues. The second concern would be related to malicious messages. The default SQS message size is 256KB, though clients can send a maximum payload size of 2GB. If input sanitization is not fully performed and fully trusted, the consuming application could be at risk.",
  "Remediation": "Scope SendMessage and SendMessageBatch to authorized principals only.",
