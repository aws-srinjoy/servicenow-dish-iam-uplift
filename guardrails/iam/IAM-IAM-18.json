  "Guardrail": "Adding Managed Policy for denying high risk APIs",
  "Rationale": "From the attacker perspective, walking through the first three steps of an attack (Reconnaissance, Scanning, and Access & Escalation), an attacker could leverage specific API calls in order to do damage to an AWS account. These particular APIs are what are commonly used in known attacks.",
  "Remediation": "Add a policy that specifically denies the APIs contained within the Reference section, and adding the policy to IAM Users and Roles that are used as service users/roles.",
