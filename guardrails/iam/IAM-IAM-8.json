  "Guardrail": "iam:CreateUser is not allowed in roles/users who do not have business justification to have it",
  "Rationale": "In enterprise environment, the need for having permissions to create IAM users is negligible. The only use case would be for power user who creates on-demand users in case of an incident or emergency. Thus, general use roles should not be having this permission.",
  "Remediation": "Removal of the action from the role unless it is whitelisted",
