  "Identifier": "IAM-S3-3",
  "Guardrail": "Check that frequently accessed data is stored in the appropriate S3 storage class.",
  "Rationale": "S3 provides varying storage classes that trade off retrieval time and cost. Glacier incurs a first byte delay on the order of minutes or hours. S3 One Zone-IA has reduced availability zones. It’s important that sensitive data is stored according to the desired availability and retrieval requirements.",
  "Remediation": "Specify the storage class condition key ‘s3:x-amz-storage-class’ on PutObject to specify the authorized storage classes for specific S3 Buckets.",
  "References": "https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazons3.html#amazons3-s3_x-amz-storage-class https://answers.amazon.com/questions/88994",
