AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy PolicyDocument.Statement.*.Action.* NOT_IN [secretsmanager:CreateSecret] << IAM-SECRETSMANAGER-3 Check for separation of duties between managing a secret and reading or writing to a secret. An administrator is required to manage creating secret via CreateSecret. Though populating the secret value including both reading GetSecretValue and writing the secret PutSecretValue should be performed by a separate principal, ideally only automation should be generating a (random) secret value and rotating the secret. Separating out the management from actually viewing the secret data reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
