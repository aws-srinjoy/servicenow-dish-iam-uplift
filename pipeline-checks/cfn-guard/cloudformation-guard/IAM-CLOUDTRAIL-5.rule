As Cloudtrail is the source for auditing of activity within your AWS Account, it is important to verify that this functionality cannot be disabled or modified by most unathorized entities within your Organization. This permission should be limited to those who own the logging capability or break glass principals. It is also important to call out that Cloudtrail supports Resource Level Permissions for individual trails, so this CloudTrail permissions can be scoped to Infosec or Logging Team owned Trails if the usecase exists for other independent teams that need access to manage their own trails.
