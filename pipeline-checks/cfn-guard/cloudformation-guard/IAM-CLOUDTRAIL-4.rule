AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy PolicyDocument.Statement.*.Action.* NOT_IN [cloudtrail:PutEventSelectors, cloudtrail:PutInsightSelectors] << IAM-CLOUDTRAIL-4 Check that Principals arenâ€™t allowed to PutEventSelectors  or PutInsightSelectors.

This permission should be limited to breakglass roles (those who own the logging capability). It is also important to call out that Cloudtrail supports Resource Level Permissions for individual trails, so this can be scoped to Infosec/Logging Team owned Trails if the usecase exists for other independent teams to need access to manage their own trails
