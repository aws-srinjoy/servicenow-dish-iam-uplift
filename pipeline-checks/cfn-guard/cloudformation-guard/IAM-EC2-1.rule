AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy PolicyDocument.Statement.*.Action.* NOT_IN [ec2:TerminateInstances] << IAM-EC2-1 Check that the ability to terminate EC2 instances are appropriately scoped or are only assumable to authorized principals. In Production or Production-like environments,no one other than IaC tools should have access to delete resources. Even in development, unintentional termination of EC2 instances can delay project timelines or delivery. If ec2:TerminateInstances has a wildcard resource policy ( Resource *) that isnâ€™t scoped with a condition statement such as ec2:ResourceTag, unauthorized EC2 instances might be inadvertently terminated.
