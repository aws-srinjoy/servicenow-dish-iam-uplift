| **Preventive Control - Pipeline** |
| 1           | As the Identity and Access Manager, our CI/CD pipeline should perform Preventive IAM checks to ensure sensitive IAM actions are only granted to authorized principals. The pipeline should halt and not allow the deployment of any IAM configuration that grants sensitive IAM actions to unauthorized principals. | | |
