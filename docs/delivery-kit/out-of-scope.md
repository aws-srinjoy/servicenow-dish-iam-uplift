## Out of Scope

1. This enagement provides customers the ability to analyze and monitor their AWS IAM Actions. If the customer needs support for AWS IAM infrastructure (e.g., federation, Active Directory, single sign-on, Landing Zone, Control Tower) the customer can engage via ProServe Security Epics.
1. This engagement can recommend tools to help identity unused IAM Roles. If the customer needs IAM Role cleanup or hands-on keyboard for large scale IAM Role cleanup, the customer can engage via a separate dedicated AWS IAM Security engagement.
1. This engagement does not guarantee that the customer can analyze 100% of all possible IAM actions, conditions, or IAM policy types.
