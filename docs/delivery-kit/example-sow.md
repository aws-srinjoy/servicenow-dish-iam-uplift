### Scope of Professional Services.
**The following is added to the Scope of AWS Professional Services section of the SOW:**

* AWS will assist Customer to design and implement automated Identity and Access Management (IAM) metric checks in a non-production environment (e.g., sample scripts to continuously identify unused IAM roles and services)
* AWS will assist Customer with creating integrated IAM permissions guardrails as preventive checks for the Customer’s Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Jenkins pipeline, which includes: 
    * Extracting requirements from Customer’s existing Terraform IAM policies to build centralized checks managed by the Customer's AWS security account
* AWS will  provide general best practices to architect automated IAM detection and remediation processes using AWS Services, such as IAM access analyzer which provides guidance on risk-level and availability considerations
* AWS will assist Customer to design and implement Service Control Policies (SCP) in a non-production environment

**Expected outcomes:**

* Sample scripts to enable the ability to continuously identify unused IAM roles and services
* Sample scripts to enable Customer to manage centralized IAM checks as part of Customer’s CI/CD pipeline
* Documentation outlining general best practices for the recommended solution
