## Contributing and Feedback

We encourage contributions based on your customer's use cases and experiences.

If you have an IAM Permission Guardrail you would like to contribute, feel free to add it directly to the wiki. You can also email us at team-permission-invariants@amazon.com or open a [SIM](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=9315ee1f-0bcd-4392-ab25-931060d58b13).

Let us know if you have feedback on how your customer would prefer to consume these guardrails. Or if you have feedback on how AWS consultants can better deliver these guardrails. Email us at team-permission-invariants@amazon.com or open a [SIM](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=9315ee1f-0bcd-4392-ab25-931060d58b13).

Guardrail contributors will receive a [phonetool icon](https://phonetool.amazon.com/awards/105107/award_icons/118903).
