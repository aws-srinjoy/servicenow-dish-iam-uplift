## Tenets (Unless you know better ones)

We encourage IAM Policies to be written securely the first time.

A handful of IAM experts within a customer doesnâ€™t scale. Thousands of global IAM experts pooling their knowledge scales.

Customers desire ready to use rules that can be easily customized based on their needs. Customer organizations do not want to start from scratch having to re-learn all the IAM pitfalls and corner cases.

Application teams desire real-time feedback with descriptions, rationales, remediations, and references to accelerate their developers writing IAM policies.

IAM Permissions analysis automation and IAM Permissions education accelerates the customer's security and application teams.

IAM Permissions Guardrails is not a blocker for application teams. IAM Permissions Guardrails is an enabler.

All AWS customers should be able to analyze their IAM policies at creation time, regardless of their choice of infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK).
