#Purpose
We are formulating the [IAM Permissions Guardrails](https://w.amazon.com/index.php/AWS/Teams/Proserve/SRC/Identity_and_Access_Management/Offerings/IAM_Audit/IAM_Permissions_Guardrails) as part of the [IAM Permissions Monitoring builder project](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS/Teams/Proserve/SRC/Identity_and_Access_Management/Offerings/IAM_Audit/). As a way to quickly provide customer value and to work backwards from defining customer use cases, we have started creating AWS Config Rules, example IAM Policies, tools, and cfn-guard rules. 
This tool can be run against a single AWS Account.

By using this repository, you agree to provide feedback on customer IAM use cases. For example, related to use cases related to montoring IAM permissions or verifying IAM policies.

Feel free to email us at team-permission-invariants@amazon.com or open a [SIM](https://sim.amazon.com/issues/create?template=9315ee1f-0bcd-4392-ab25-931060d58b13).
